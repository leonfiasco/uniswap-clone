# functionality
The app allows users to connect to their online wallet (preferably metamask) and to send test ether from one address to another and once the transaction has successfully gone
through there will be a pop up at the bottom of the screen showing the date/time of the transaction and a link to etherscan that will show the actual transaction on the blockchain and I used sanity
as a database which shows the address of both recipient and sender and also the amount
